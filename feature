// Features:
// 1. Allow the user to choose a date and time, then show a list of locations with traffic cam
// photos for the specified date and time. (API 1: Traffic Images)

// 2. Show the list of locations from API 1 (Traffic Images) only has lat/long without name, use a
// reverse geocoding service (API 2: Weather Forecast) to display more user friendly location
// names
// 3. When the user selects a location from the list, show the traffic cam photo, and also the
// weather info for that location from API 2 (Weather Forecast) (or the nearest available
// weather info depending on what API 2 can return)
// As the location information are returned in latitude and longitude format, you are required to look for
// an API that does reverse geo-coding to show its human readable names instead.
